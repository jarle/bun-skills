# Delete files

To delete a file, use `Bun.file(path).delete()`.

```ts delete-file.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV&q=85&s=5d73d76daf7eb7b158469d8c30d349b0" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
// Delete a file
const file = Bun.file("path/to/file.txt");
await file.delete();

// Now the file doesn't exist
const exists = await file.exists();
// => false
```
