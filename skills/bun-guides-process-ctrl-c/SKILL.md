# Listen for CTRL+C

The `ctrl+c` shortcut sends an *interrupt signal* to the running process. This signal can be intercepted by listening for the `SIGINT` event. If you want to close the process, you must explicitly call `process.exit()`.

```ts process.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV&q=85&s=5d73d76daf7eb7b158469d8c30d349b0" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
process.on("SIGINT", () => {
  console.log("Ctrl-C was pressed");
  process.exit();
});
```
