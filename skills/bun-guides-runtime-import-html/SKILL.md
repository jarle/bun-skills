# Import a HTML file as text

To import a `.html` file in Bun as a text file, use the `type: "text"` attribute in the import statement.

```ts file.ts icon="https://mintcdn.com/bun-1dd33a4e/nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV/icons/typescript.svg?fit=max&auto=format&n=nIz6GtMH5K-dfXeV&q=85&s=5d73d76daf7eb7b158469d8c30d349b0" theme={"theme":{"light":"github-light","dark":"dracula"}}
import html from "./file.html" with { type: "text" };

console.log(html); // <!DOCTYPE html><html><head>...
```

This can also be used with hot module reloading and/or watch mode to force Bun to reload whenever the `./file.html` file changes.
